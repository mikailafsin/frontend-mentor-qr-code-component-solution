## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I aim to have more control over images in future projects. I don't feel completely comfortable playing with images, but I felt completely comfortable playing with images on this project. As I said, I say this for future projects. On the other hand, I aim to use the flexbox structure more in future projects and to achieve perfection while having full control over it.
